> This is the work done on a paper published by Feng et al. The repository proposes different models like the black box ResNET50 with IMAGENET1K_V2 weights and compares them with the bottleneck.
The only models allowed to work on the problem proposed by Feng are proposed by OpenAI. The authors claim the open source LLama can be used too, which should not be possible, at least in Italy, where the only LLama models available are "language only".

1 - First alanalyses the CUB dataset to build a "label.csv" which organizes the overaldata into a subset of 179 elements, labels and four basic concepts in a CSV. Script: assemble_cub_birds.py
2 - Divides the data in train and test (10% of the data) train_test_split.py
3 - Trains ResNet50 for multiclass classification

##Main Changes

I allowed LLama to read vectors instead of images.


## Starting the experiment

**Requirements**

1 - Install Python 3.12.9 > conda install python=3.12
2 - Install all packages from requirements.txt > pip install -r requirements.txt

**Dataset settings**

1 - Download the CUB dataset from here: https://data.caltech.edu/records/65de6-vp158
2 - Rename CUB as data/CUB_200_2011
3 - Move "data" folder into exp_cub_birds_existing

**Access Models**

Create a .env with the access token for HuggingFace
HF_ACCESS_TOKEN=TOKEN

**Running the code**

1 - Type on terminal > scons exp_cub_birds_existing
